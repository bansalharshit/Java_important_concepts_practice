Java Theory Based Question 
==============================
1. What is Java?
Answer 1. Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in may 1995. It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.

features of java programming language
=====================================
1.Simple: Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the program in it.

2.Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.

3. Portable: Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.

4. Platform Independent: Java is a platform independent programming language. It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.

5. Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.

6. Robust: Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust.

7. Multithreaded: We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.

1A What is the Difference Between JDK, JRE and JVM?
Answer 1A 
JVM
======>Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code. JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.

JRE
======>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment.It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

JDK
=======>JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools. JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:

a.Standard Edition Java Platform
b.Enterprise Edition Java Platform
c.Micro Edition Java Platform

2. Version of Java?

Anser 2 As of September 2022, Java 19 is the latest released Java version. In March 2023, Java 20 will follow. The last long-term support version (LTS) of Java is Java 17, released in September 2021.

2a. Why are companies still stuck with Java 8?
answer 2a. Build tools (Maven, Gradle etc.) and some libraries initially had bugs with versions Java versions > 8 and needed updates
Some companies have policies to only use LTS versions and rely on their OS vendors to provide them these builds, which takes time.
 until Java 8 you were pretty much using Oracleâ€™s JDK builds and you did not have to care about licensing. Oracle changed the licensing scheme In 2019,


3. What is string?
Answer 3. In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. An array of characters works same as Java string. For example:
char[] ch={'j','a','v','a','t','p','o','i','n','t'};  
String s=new String(ch);  

String s="javatpoint";  
Java String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on strings such as compare(), concat(), equals(), split(), length(), replace(), compareTo(), intern(), substring() etc.

4. Why String are immutable?
Answer 4.  The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it.But we can only change the reference to the object.

for example:
import java.util.*;  
class ImmutableString{    
    public static void main(String args[]){    
        String NewString = "Hello";    
        NewString.concat("World");  
        System.out.println(NewString);    
    }    
} 
output:-> Hello

import java.util.*;  
class ImmutableString{    
    public static void main(String args[]){    
        String NewString = "Hello";    
        NewString = NewString.concat("World");  
        System.out.println(NewString);    
    }    
}   

output:-> HelloWorld

5. can we override the static Method?
Anser 5.No, we can not override the static Method because method overriding is based on dynamic binding at runtime and the static methods are bonded using static binding at compile time. So, we cannot override static methods.

5a. what is static Method
answer5a. The method that has a static keyword before the method name is known as a static method. It is also known as a class-level method. A copy of the static method is shared by all the objects of the class.The static method cannot access instance variables or methods.

5b. why static method can not call the non-static method or non-static  variable?
answer 5b. A non-static method is dependent on the object. It is recognized by the program once the object is created. But a static method can be called before the object creation. Hence you cannot make the reference.

6. any five method of string?
Answer 6.comapre(),concat(),equals(),split(),length(),replace(),compareTo(),substring().

7. Difference between String Buffer and String Builder?
Answer7. 
String Buffer:
==================> 

1.StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
2.StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder.
3.StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0

String Builder
==================>
1.StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.5
2.StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.
3.StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.

Example Of StringBuffer
=========================
public class BufferTest{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuffer buffer=new StringBuffer("Hello");
buffer.append("java");
System.out.println(buffer);
}
}
output: hellojava

Example of StringBuilder
============================
public class BufferTest{
public static void main(String[] args){
StringBuilder builder=new StringBuilder("Hello");
builder.append("Java");
}
}
output: HelloJava

8. Stack Memory vs Heap Memory?
Answer 8. The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. 

StackMemory
=============
1.Application:	It stores items that have a very short life such as methods, variables, and reference variables of the objects.
2. Ordering: it follows the LIFO order.
3. Efficiency: it has faster access,allocation,and deallocation.
4. MemorySize: it is smaller in size;
5. Visibility of Scope: The Variable are visible only to the owner thread.
6. Generation of Space: When a thread is created, the operating system automatically allocates the stack.
7.Allocation/Deallocation: it is done automatically by the compiler.
8. Thread-safety: it is thread-safe because each thread has its own stack.
9.Exception Throws: Jvm throws the java.lang.StackOverFlowError(if stack size is greater than limit)

HeapMemory/HeapSapce
======================
1.Application:	It stores Ojects and java Runtime Environment (JRE) classes.
2. Ordering: it does not follow any order because it is a dynamic memory allocation
3. Efficiency: it has slower access,allocation,and deallocation.
4. MemorySize: it is larger in size;
5. Visibility of Scope: The Variable are visible to all thread.
6. Generation of Space:To create the heap space for the application, the language first calls the operating system at run time.
7.Allocation/Deallocation: It is done manually by the programmer.
8. Thread-safety: It is not thread-safe, so properly synchronization of code is required.
9.Exception Throws: Jvm throws the java.lang.OutOfMemoryError(if the jvm is unable to create a new native method);

9. what is String Pool?

Anser9. String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap where string literals stores. It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool.

Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory. Creating a number of strings may increase the cost and memory too which may reduce the performance also.

When we create a string literal, the JVM first check that literal in the String pool. If the literal is already present in the pool, it returns a reference to the pooled instance. If the literal is not present in the pool, a new String object takes place in the String pool.

10. final finally finalize
Answer 10. The final, finally, and finalize are keywords in Java.The basic difference between final, finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier, finally is the block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class.

final
========
1.Definition:-->final is the keyword and access modifier which is used to apply restrictions on a class, method or variable.
2.Application to:-->Final keyword is used with the classes, methods and variables.
3.Functionality:---->1) Once declared, final variable becomes constant and cannot be modified.
(2) final method cannot be overridden by sub class.
(3) final class cannot be inherited.
4. Execution:-->Final method is executed only when we call it.

Finally
=========>
1.Definition:-->finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not.
2.Application to:-->Finally block is always related to the try and catch block in exception handling
3.Functionality:---->(1) finally block runs the important code even if exception occurs or not.
(2) finally block cleans up all the resources used in try block
4. Execution:-->Finally block is executed as soon as the try-catch block is executed.
It's execution is not dependant on the exception

Finalize
================>
1.Definition:-->finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.
2.Application to:-->finalize() method is used with the objects
3.Functionality:---->(1) finalize method performs the cleaning activities with respect to the object before its destruction.

4. Execution:-->finalize method is executed just before the object is destroyed

10a. what is garbage collection in java?
answer 10a.Garbage Collection is a process to destrory the unused objects due to which java provides better memory management.

Advantage of Garbage Collection
===================================
1. it makes java memory efficeint because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from the heap memory.
2. it is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of jvm) so we don't need to make extra efforts.

Note: the garbage collector of jvm collects only those objects that are created by new keywords .so if you have created any object without new keyword you can use finalize mehtod to perform cleanup processing(destroying remaining objects)

gc() Method
==============
The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage collector to perform cleanup processing . the gc() is found in System and runtime classes.
 
11. what is method overloading and method overriding?
Answer 11.
Method overLoading
=====================>
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

Method overloading increases the readability of the program.
There are two ways to overload the method in java

1.By changing number of arguments
2.By changing the data type

Method Overriding
===================>
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

Rules for Java Method Overriding
1. The Method must have the same name as in the parent class.
2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. there must be an is-a relationshi(inheritance)

11a.Why Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of method only?
Answer 11a. Because of Ambiguity.
class Adder{
static int add(int a,int b){return a+b};
static double add(int a,int b){return a+b};
}
class TestOverloading{
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println(Adder.add(11,12));// ambiguity
}
}

11B can we overload java main() method?
Answer 11b. Yes, by method overloading. You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM calls main() method which receives string array as arguments only. Let's see the simple example:
class TestOverloading4{  
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("main with String[]")
}
  
public static void main(String args){
System.out.println("main with String")
}
  
public static void main(){
System.out.println("main without args")
}  
}  

12. What is Abstraction?
Answer 12. Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Ways to achieve Abstraction
=============================
1. Abstract class(0 to 100%)
2. Interface(100%)

Abstract class
================> A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.It can have constructors and static methods also.It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

Abstract Method
==================>A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.

for example : abstract void printStatus();//no method body and abstract 

13. What is Encapsulation and inheritance?
Answser 13. 
Inheritance
=============>Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

Note: Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

why we use inheritance
=========================
1. For method Overriding (so runtime Polymorphism can be achieved).
2. for Code Reusability.

Note: extends--> the meaning of extends is to increase the functionality.

Types of Inheritance in java
===============================>
on the class level: single multilevel and hierarchical
on the interface level: mulitple and hybrid

why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?
answer to reduce the complexity and simplify the language , mulitple inheritance is not supported in java.in short ambiguity problem will arise.

for example:
=============
class A{  
void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}  
class B{  
void msg(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
}  
class C extends A,B{//suppose if it were  
   
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   C obj=new C();  
   obj.msg();//Now which msg() method would be invoked?  
}  
} 
output: compile time error

Encapsulation
++++++++++++++++>Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.

Advantage of Encapsulation
===========================>
1. way to achieve "Data Hiding" in java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
 2. the encapsulate class is eays to test. so it is better in unit testing.

//A Java class which is a fully encapsulated class.  
//It has a private data member and getter and setter methods.  
package com.javatpoint;  
public class Student{  
//private data member  
private String name;  
//getter method for name  
public String getName(){  
return name;  
}  
//setter method for name  
public void setName(String name){  
this.name=name  
}  
}  

package com.javatpoint;  
class Test{  
public static void main(String[] args){  
//creating instance of the encapsulated class  
Student s=new Student();  
//setting value in the name member  
s.setName("vijay");  
//getting value of the name member  
System.out.println(s.getName());  
}  
} 

output: vijay
note: comile by javac Test.java
runby:java com.javapoint.Test/ java Test

13a. what is class?
Answer 13a. A class is a group of objects which have common properties. it is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

14. What is Enum?
Answer 14. An Enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables,like final variables).

enum Level{
LOW,
MEDIUM,
HIGH
}

Level myVar=Level.MEDIUM;
note: Enum is short for enumerations which means specifically listed.

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar);
  }
}
output: MEDIUM

Enum in a swithch Statement

enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM;

    switch(myVar) {
      case LOW:
        System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
      case MEDIUM:
         System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
      case HIGH:
        System.out.println("High level");
        break;
    }
  }
}

output: Medium Level

Loop Through an Enum
======================
the enum type has a value() method, which returns an array  of all enum constants. This method is useful when you want to loop through the constants of an enum:

for(Level myVar : Level.values()){
System.out.println(myVar):
}

output:
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH

14a. Difference Between Enums and Classes
An enum can, just like a class, have attributes and methods. The only difference is that enum constants are public, static and final (unchangeable - cannot be overridden).

An enum cannot be used to create objects, and it cannot extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).

15. what is Interface and polymorphism?
Answer 15. 
Interface
===========>The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

It cannot be instantiated just like the abstract class./ or we can not make the object of interface

Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.

Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

15a. Why we use java interface?
Answer 15a.
1. it is used to achieve abstraction.
2. we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
3. it can be used to achieve loose coupling.

15b. what is marker or tagged interface?
answer 15b. An interface which has no member is known as a marker or tagged interface, for example, Serializable, Cloneable, Remote, etc.

public interface Serializable{
}
Note: nested interface is possible
interface printTable{
void print();
interface MessagePrintable{
void msg();
}
}


16. what is super keyword?
Answer 16. The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.
Usage of Usper Keyword
=======================>
1. Super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2. super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3. super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

Case1. class Animal{  
String color="white";  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
String color="black";  
void printColor(){  
System.out.println(color);//prints color of Dog class  
System.out.println(super.color);//prints color of Animal class  
}  
}  
class TestSuper1{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog d=new Dog();  
d.printColor();  
}}  

output: black , white

case2: class Animal{  
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
void eat(){System.out.println("eating bread...");}  
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}  
void work(){  
super.eat();  
bark();  
}  
}  
class TestSuper2{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog d=new Dog();  
d.work();  
}}  

output: eating..
barking.....

Case3: class Animal{  
Animal(){System.out.println("animal is created");}  
}  
class Dog extends Animal{  
Dog(){  
super();  
System.out.println("dog is created");  
}  
}  
class TestSuper3{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Dog d=new Dog();  
}}  

output: 
animal is created
dog is created

17. what is constructor?
Answer 17. In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

Note: ava compiler provides a default constructor by default.

There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.

Remark: A java constructor cannot be abstract static final and synchronized buyt it could be private protected pubic or default 

17a what is the purpose of a default constructor?
answer 17a. the default constructor is used to provide the default values ot the objects like 0, null etc depending on the types.
